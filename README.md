# GenSearch

## Revolutionizing Search Through AI and RAG

### Overview

GenSearch is an innovative search platform that transforms how users interact with information online. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), GenSearch provides accurate, context-aware, and highly personalized search results.

Traditional search engines rely on keywords, which often fail to capture the user's true intent. GenSearch overcomes this limitation by integrating AI, enabling it to understand the context and intent behind each query. This approach ensures smarter, more intuitive, and efficient searches tailored to individual user needs.

### Problem Statement

Traditional search engines are limited in their ability to provide accurate, personalized, and context-aware results. The combination of AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this gap, enabling smarter search experiences that:

- Personalize user interactions by understanding context and intent.
- Deliver richer and more interactive search results through integration with advanced technologies.

This project aims to demonstrate the possibilities of AI-powered search innovation, highlighting how it can revolutionize the way we interact with information online.
